    //TODO Abstract class design: Consider the group of classes that you designed.
    // Suppose you had a web program that used these classes,
    // and you needed to assign a unique ID to every object created from one of these classes within the application.
    // Therefore, each such class should have an Id property,
    // and no two objects created from any of the classes may have the same value for Id.
    // Create an abstract class, AbstractEntity,
    // that contains the behavior for assigning and accessing such a unique ID for each class that extends it.
    // Add this class to your program
